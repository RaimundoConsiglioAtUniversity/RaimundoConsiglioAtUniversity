Hullo! Iâ€™m Raimundo Consiglio, and this is my GitHub Profile for my University ^c^
I'm a massive Brony, a self proclaimed ferroequinologist (I like trains :p), and I love video games like Mario and Stardew Valley :3
Currently focused on learning Unity and C#, as well as dabbling in Unreal, Ruby, HTML, and CSS
